# Make .Rexec files into executable R files under Windows

The file `config_Rexec_for_R-3.X.X.bat` uses commands 'ASSOC' and 'FTYPE' to make .Rexec files like R executable files. 
It is created after Peter Meissner's post [`Making R Files Executable (under Windows)'](http://www.r-datacollection.com/blog/Making-R-files-executable/) on R-DataCollection Blog. 

The file `unconfig_Rexec.bat` undoes what the preceding file does.
